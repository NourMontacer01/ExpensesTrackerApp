Building adaptive apps in Flutter means your UI can adjust to the platform on which it’s being displayed, whether it's Android or iOS. You can use the same widgets and styles across platforms, but sometimes, minor tweaks are necessary.

For example, Flutter automatically centers the title on iOS (default behavior), but you can customize it by setting centerTitle: false. The font may differ too, as Flutter uses a different default font on iOS.

You may also want platform-specific UI elements, like using iOS-styled dialogs. Flutter provides the showCupertinoDialog() method to implement iOS-specific dialog styling. You can use CupertinoAlertDialog for this and adjust it with title, content, and actions parameters, just like the regular Material dialog.

To decide which dialog to show based on the platform, use the Platform class from Dart. It’s essential to import dart:io and check Platform.isIOS to display the appropriate dialog.

For layout adaptation, Flutter provides the LayoutBuilder widget. This widget listens to the available space and dynamically adjusts the layout, unlike MediaQuery, which focuses on screen size. It uses the constraints object to determine how much space the widget has and can adjust its layout accordingly.

For example, in a responsive layout, you could conditionally display widgets using an if statement based on available width, like adding a Row if the width is greater than 600px. This lets you position widgets side by side on larger screens and in a single column on smaller ones.

For text fields in a row, you might use Expanded to avoid constraint issues, ensuring that widgets behave as expected across different screen sizes and orientations.

By using LayoutBuilder and Platform checks, you can create adaptive, platform-specific UIs while maintaining a consistent app experience across Android and iOS.
